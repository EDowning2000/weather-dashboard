Application written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
The moment.js library, and bootstrap libraries were used
The purpose of the app is to show the weather given the city that the user prompts. It will display current weather stats, along with a five day forecast. 
It starts out by showing the weather for orlando, but as you type in other cities, they are added to the sidebar and clickable.
